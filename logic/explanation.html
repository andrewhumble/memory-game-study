    <h1>Task Performance, Emotions, and Heart Rate as Indicators for Perceived Stress</h1>
</head>

<body class="container pull-left">

    In this experiment, you will be asked to solve word puzzles with different levels of difficulty. Before that you
    will
    be
    placed in one of three groups: <i>no support through adaptation</i>, <i>task performance</i>, or <i>AI-based
        analysis of the
        camera
        image</i>.
    <h2>What can be Inferred from the Task Performance?</h2>
    <p>The task performance provides details about your individual processing efficiency. If you
        solve
        tasks in a sequence correctly or incorrectly, this is an indicator of good or bad performance. The task
        difficulty will
        be adjusted accordingly to match the current performance level. For example, tasks will become easier if many
        tasks were
        previously answered incorrectly and tasks will become harder if many tasks were previously answered correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>Which Details are Analyzed with a Camera Image?</h2>
    <p>An artificial intelligence (AI) captures the face and provides details about stress levels and
        emotional states. The stress level
        is
        calculated by analyzing the face to detect changes in blood circulation and pulse [1]. Recent scientific
        research has
        shown that pulse changes are related to the current level of perceived stress [2]. Emotional states can also be
        derived
        from facial features (smiling, frowning), which are indicative of the current affective state [3]. Using these
        two
        indicators, task difficulty can be inferred and adjusted to avoid frustration due to tasks that were too
        difficult or
        too easy using an AI. The following example illustrates how the AI takes
        into
        account stress and emotions to adjust the task difficulty. By extracting the pulse and the felt emotions, a
        low
        stress level is implied. Therefore, the tasks become more difficult:</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The analysis of the camera image by the AI shows an average pulse and
                    thus a low stress-level. The tasks become somewhat
                    more difficult.</b></div><br>
            <b>Sample image removed for blind review</b>
            <br>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    The following example shows a user who is a bit annoyed and has a slightly elevated heart rate. From now on, the
    system
    makes the tasks easier.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The analysis of the camera image shows an increased pulse and thus an
                    increased stress-level. The tasks become somewhat
                    easier.</b></div><br>
            <b>Sample image removed for blind review</b>
